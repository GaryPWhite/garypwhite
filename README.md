## Hi! I'm Gary.

I write software that is regularly acceptable. I work for Wayfair, helping other developers make changes to the Open Source community and make Wayfair engineering more productive. I care about Developer Relations and building Developer Confidence.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on strenghthening Wayfair Open Source presence and community.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust to help with [the tremor project](https://github.com/tremor-rs). ðŸ¦€
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OSS like Tremor or awesome-learning
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about videogames, developer relations, Wayfair, and digital transformation as it relates to the cloud
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email gwhite at wayfair, discord (ping me for my handle)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have made 500+ emojis for Wayfair's internal slack channel, and 20 more for my own discord.
